The workshop will span two and a half days on the 2025-05-26 â€“ 2025-05-28 and aimed mainly at PhD students and early postdocs (but any interested SPP member is welcome to join).

The workshop syllabus covers the topics *Best Practices for Reproducible Scripting* (Session 1), *Version Control Basics* (Session 2), *Project Structure* (Session 3), *Workflow Management* (Session 4) and the usage of *Containerization* (Session 5).

We are going to talk about reproducibility of projects at different scales, starting from a simple small `R` analysis to more complex projects.
Examples in the workshop are mostly going to focus on `R` and `bash`, but they should translate well to `python` or `julia` too.
Tools that are going to be introduced include:
`git`, `snakemake`, `conda` and `apptainer`.
The workshop is designed to be 'hands on', and to provide participants with examples and templates that they later can build on.

Each session is going to contain an introductory briefing (10min), a short presentation (40min), followed by a longer hands-on session (2:30h):
